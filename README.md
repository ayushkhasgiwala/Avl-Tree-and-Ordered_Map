# Avl-Tree-and-Ordered_Map

Implemented Avl tree which can handle duplicates and have used it to develop a generic ordered map

## Operations implemented in AVL tree:

Duplicates are also handled in the avl tree

Operations                          Complexity

1 Insertion  =                       O(log N)

2 Deletion   =                       O(log N)

3 Search     =                       O(log N)

4 Count occurrences of element =     O(log N)

5 lower_bound      =                 O(log N)

6 upper_bound    =                   O(log N)

7 Closest Element to some value =    O(log N)

8 K-th largest element     =         O(log N)

9 Count the number of elements in 
the tree whose                      
values fall into a given range.= O(log N)

## Operations Implemented in Ordered_Map

Operations:

1. insert(key, value) –  [O(log n)]

2. erase(key) – [O(log n)]

3. find(key) –  [O(logn)]

4. map_obj[key] (subscript operator) – Access the element with the
given key(if it is present in the map). Also, able to
modify the value at this key using this operator. If the value is not
present, then insert this key with it’s corresponding assigned value.
[O(log n)]

5. size() – [O(1)]

6. clear() –  [O(n)]
